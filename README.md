Medical Health Prescription App 

The Medical Health Prescription App is a smart tool designed to help patients clearly understand the medicines prescribed by their doctors. The app can read and recognize tablet names written on a prescription—especially when handwriting is difficult to read—and instantly displays the correct medicine names in a clear, easy-to-understand format. This reduces confusion, prevents mistakes, and ensures patients take the right medication at the right time. With simple scanning, accurate text recognition, and a user-friendly interface, the app provides peace of mind for patients and supports safer, more confident medical care.
